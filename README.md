Udemy Clone:

This is a basic Udemy homepage clone created using HTML and CSS.
The project focuses on practicing layout design, styling, and responsiveness without using any JavaScript.

It includes:
Navigation bar with categories.
Course recommendation section.
Topic suggestion cards.

This project helped me improve my frontend fundamentals and understand how real-world websites are structured using HTML and CSS.
